# Mobile App Design

What is my app?

    - For this project I will be designing a car spotting app called Auto-Eye with the tagline 'See it. Love it. Log it'

    - Auto-Eye will be a mobile app designed specifically for car enthusiasts and anyone who appreciates automobiles. With the tagline “See it. Love it. Log it,” Auto-Eye aims to   offer users a platform where they can document the cars they’ve spotted, engage with fellow car spotters, and share their passion for vehicles. This app will be beneficial for anyone wanting to keep track of the exciting vehicles they see on the streets, in parking lots, or at events. 

    - Auto-Eye goes beyond simply logging vehicles. It allows users to analyse the data they have gathered over time as well as data that other users have gathered. This allows users to determine which locations, days, and times feature the most interesting or rare vehicles. This feature helps users plan their future car spotting, making it easier to find the cars they might find interesting


What are the main features of Auto-Eye?

    - Auto-Eye offers a wide range of features to ensure that users can capture, interact with, and make the most out of their car spotting experiences. The primary features of the app are:

        - Vehicle Logging and Details
          - One of the core features of Auto-Eye is its ability to allow users to log the vehicles they have spotted. Users can enter detailed information about each vehicle, including its make, model, year, colour, location, and the exact date it was seen. Users can also upload images of the vehicles they spot, allowing them to create a visual log of their sightings. 

        - Friends Feature
          - Auto-Eye will include a social component where users can add friends by username, allowing them to view their friends' vehicle logs and stay updated on the cars their friends have spotted. By following friends, users can compare their sightings, share their experiences, and even discuss their favourite vehicles.

        - Planning Feature for Car Spotting Events
          - Another exciting aspect of Auto-Eye is its planning feature, which allows users to create and join car spotting events. Users can set up events with specific dates and locations, inviting other users to join. This makes it easy to plan group car spotting trips or attend local events with other enthusiasts. The app allows users to discover the best times and locations for spotting based on historical data, which helps users maximise their chances of seeing rare or exciting vehicles.

        - Offline Mode
          - While Auto-Eye relies on an internet connection for some features like interacting with friends and planning events, it will also include an offline mode. Users can continue logging vehicles even when they don’t have an active internet connection. The app will save the data locally, and when the user regains internet access, the information will sync automatically. This feature ensures that users can continue car spotting without worrying about connectivity issues.



who are the main users of the app?
    

    - The primary target users of Auto-Eye are car enthusiasts—individuals who have a strong passion for vehicles and enjoy documenting their sightings. However, the app is designed to appeal to a wide range of people. It will also target those who are new to car spotting and wish to explore the hobby, as well as casual users who simply appreciate well-designed cars and want to track the ones they encounter.

    - Auto-Eye is accessible to anyone who owns a mobile device, ensuring that it reaches a broad audience. The app will be particularly appealing to individuals who enjoy both the spotting cars and the satisfaction of documenting their sightings. Whether you're an expert in the automotive world or someone who just enjoys seeing unique cars on the road, Auto-Eye will provide a space to share and celebrate those experiences.

    - For those without consistent internet access, Auto-Eye’s offline mode allows users to still capture their sightings without missing out on the app’s core functionality. Once they’re back online, they can sync their logs and share them with their friends.
