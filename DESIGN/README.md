# Mobile App Design

What is my app?

    - For this project I will be designing a car spotting app called Auto-Eye with the tagline 'See it. Love it. Log it'

    - Auto-Eye will contain multiple features allowing users to to not only log interesting cars that they have seen, but will also allow them to record other information 
      relating to the vehicles such as make, model, year, colour, location spotted, date spotted, and more. Other features will allow users to add friends by username so 
      they are able to keep track of vehichles that their friends have seen and logged as well as be able to display vehicles that they have seen for their friends.

    - Users will be able to use these records to determine which locations, days, and times feautre the most interesting vehicles. This users can use this information to plan where and when to go if they wish to go car spotting to maximise the chances of seeing interesting vehicles.


What are the main features of Auto-Eye?

    - Auto-Eye will contain multiple primary features to maximise user satisfaction and app usablility. Some of these features include:
        - Logging interesting vehicles seen and relevant information about them as well as images of the vehicles
        - Friends feature allowing users to connect with and interact with their friends and look at which vehicles they have logged 
        - Planning feature which allows users to create events visible to other users to go car spotting with dates and locations

who are the main users of the app?
    

    - The primary target users of this app will be existing car enthusiasts as well as people just starting out as a car enthusiats. This app will also target non car enthusiasts but
      people who just gernerally appreciate cars and wish to keep track of vehicles that they and heir friends a=have spotted. Keeping this in mind this app will still be accessible 
      to anyone who has access to a mobile device. An internet connection will be necessary for some features, such as friendsand planning, however there will be an offline mode to
      keep track of vehicles that the offline user has spotted themselves.
